# optimization-solver
Solver for optimization tasks.

It consists of two parts: computation (C++, MPI) and helper (Python).<br />

Computation program can start three different algorithm:<br />
1) Annealing algorithm.<br />
2) Differential evolution.<br />
3) Random mutations.<br />

Helper uses paramiko for managing ssh-connection.
